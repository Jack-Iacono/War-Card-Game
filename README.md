# War Card Game

This code will run a simulation of a game or of several (100,000 games) of War. This is assuming that no card shuffling happens half way through the game and all rules are followed correctly. This code will also output the statistics of each game or set of games which are played.

This project was made during a vacation that I was on. My step brother and I were playing a game of war and I though "I can code this". This lead to the completion of this project. Hopefully you find it as intriguing as I do.
